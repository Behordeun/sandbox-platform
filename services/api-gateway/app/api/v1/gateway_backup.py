# This file is a backup of the old proxy-based gateway implementation
# It has been replaced with individual endpoint modules that mirror backend services
# and automatically forward bearer tokens for authentication

# The new structure includes:
# - auth_endpoints.py - Authentication and user management
# - nin_endpoints.py - NIN verification service
# - bvn_endpoints.py - BVN verification service
# - sms_endpoints.py - SMS messaging service
# - ai_endpoints.py - AI/LLM service
# - health_endpoints.py - Health monitoring
# - examples_endpoints.py - Integration examples

# Key improvements:
# 1. No more proxy pattern - direct endpoint mirroring
# 2. Automatic bearer token forwarding via TokenForwardingMiddleware
# 3. Consistent authentication requirements using get_current_user dependency
# 4. Better error handling and circuit breaker integration
# 5. Cleaner API documentation with proper endpoint descriptions
